# Games steps

## What I plan to add in my game

- Rules of the game: The player will try to hit guess where the mole is hiding under the table that is filled with holes. If the player guesses where the mole is they take a life away from the mole. The mole has three lives. Once you take away all the three lives away from the mole, you advance onto the next stage where the levels has all sorts of tricks and twist up its sleeve.

- Stage 1: Player can click on mole when it appears and hit it.

- Stage 2: If the player does not take away all the mole lives within the time limit, they will lose. Time limit will be 1 minute 30 seconds.

## HTML

- Display name of "Player" will be shown
- There will be 12 holes
- Every hole will come under a section
- Add a timer
- Add a table

## CSS

- The background will be red
- Every hole will be the same size and colour
- The holes will be black
- Create a gameboard

## JavaScript

- Create a random object
- Random function will be added for the mole
- Put a countdown timer
- Add click element

## Features that woud be out of scope for Thursday

- I would like to add more levels for the player to advance to (3 Levels).
  This will concist of the mole having tools that they can use to protect them from not getting hit. Tools being random onbject such as red herrings.

- Each level increases difficulty being the time decreasing and red herrings appearing

- The mole will move faster in pace betwen the holes in order to avoid being hit, thus making it harder for the player and completing it within the given time.

- When the player guesses correctly and hits the mole twice in a row they gain an extra life.
